# Abstract
This project was a hotel reservation system that supports both users and a hotel manager.  The users can see a list of all bookings they have made, as well as how much they have spent.  They can also book rooms for themselves.  The manager sees a list of bookings for that day, as well as daily revenue, percent of rooms booked, and the amount and details of rooms available.  The manager can also search users by name and book rooms/delete bookings for the users.
